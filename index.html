              About me:
            </div>
            <p>
              Born into a family of musicians and continuing a lineage of Irish traditional fiddle playing
              from the age of 6, I also received classical violin and piano tuition and taught myself various
              other instruments (guitar, bass, flute, etc) in my early teens. Since then I've been performing,
              recording and composing professionally, as well as producing 8-bit/chiptune music in the Demoscene
              under the name Syphus since the early 1990s. When in the 2000s chipmusic finally became cool enough
              to perform in public, I gigged as Syphus around the world with my Commodore Amiga and a keytar -
              particular highlights included two Chiptune Alliance tours and Blip Festival 2008 in NYC.
              <br/><br/>

              Back in the studio, I've produced commissioned
              work for a wide range of clients including BBC Radio 3 Drama, BBC Radio 4 Drama,
              Sunderland A.F.C., Newcastle United Foundation,
              The Centre for Process Innovation, We Are Strongness and FME;
              and for numerous video games on PC/Mac, consoles and mobile.
              <br/><br/>

              Right now I'm lucky enough to be fulfilling a lifelong dream: making video games!
              Currently I'm employed by <a href="https://cardboardsword.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cardboard Sword</a>
              as Audio Director working on audio implementation and logic; dynamic/procedural music
              systems; composition; and sound design/Foley.
              <br/><br/>

              I'm occasionally available for film and TV location sound recording work and can supply my own kit including:
              Sound Devices 633 recorder; SQN mixers; Zoom F8/F4/H5 backup recorders; microphones by Neumann, Sennheiser, Audix, Sanken, Oktava, Tram,
              OST and LOM; radio wireless. I also offer portable voice-over recording, location Foley recording,
              and audio post-production services.
              <br/><br/>

              Beyond audio, I have many years' experience as a web, mobile app & hybrid desktop app developer,
              having delivered projects for clients including the NHS, King's College London,
              Newcastle University, the Great North Children's Hospital & the West End Refugee Service. I also develop open-source music software for
              fun - available on <a href="https://github.com/echolevel" title="Echolevel on GitHub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.

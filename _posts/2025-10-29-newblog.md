Every few years, usually when I'm sick and can't concentrate on proper work, I redesign this website. My ideal website would be no website, but even in this day and age it's sort of obligatory for someone in my lines of work to have a place to dump their CV and some links to stuff they've done. Either that or it's the sunk cost fallacy of having had this domain for about 20 years and not wanting to let go.

Running a close second would be the simplest possible website, just a few bits of HTML and CSS with no database, no javascript and no CMS backend to maintain and patch. This yearning reached its zenith when I was doing 'proper' web dev professionally - building full-stack custom platforms for clients while the web dev world's horrifying reliance on brittle packaging systems and quickly evolving framework hype trains started to really snowball in the mid-2010s.

Up until a few days ago I was hosting my very simple static HTML+CSS site on Firebase, mostly because I couldn't be bothered to figure out GitHub Pages' Jekyll implementation but also because I didn't need to update it at any frequency greater than...annually-ish. Perhaps even less. When you're working on games industry projects for years at a time, and almost everything is under NDA, there's often nothing you can say about them.

The catalyst for this latest overhaul (other than catching a chest infection and wanting to faff about with Jekyll as a form of low stakes non-work therapy) was that I thought it *might* be nice to occasionally make dev blog posts based on things I've learnt, bugs I've solved, and rationales for design/engineering strategies that I've arrived at in my work.

I'm not sure if anyone would be interested, but at the same time I don't care if nobody is. I have no visitor tracking or even hit counting on this website (GitHub allegedly does this, but the Traffic sections of my repos always tell me there isn't enough data - perhaps that speaks for itself). I definitely don't/won't have a comment plugin. I'm forever trying to withdraw from toxic social media (ie...social media) and the idea of having to experience even a single unwanted interaction amongst many harmless ones is horrifying. I'm still on Bluesky, and any time I post a dev blog I'll mention it on Bluesky - it's probably the only thing that'll drive traffic here and it's likely only to reach the very small handful of people in the world who'd be interested anyway. That suits me fine! And not knowing if anyone is reading: that's also fine. If someone chances upon it in a desperate search result while experiencing some niche problem that I eventually managed to solve, great!

As for GitHub Pages/Jekyll - I like it, I think? I initially resented having to install Ruby for a local dev environment but it's fine; the whole Liquid templating/logic thing gives me nice Tumblr vibes (oldskool Tumblr, not modern day, we'll-inject-ads-into-your-blog Tumblr), and it's nice to work locally in markdown and publish static pages with a git push to a server for whose security someone else is responsible. 

I've catered for some basics like `inline code` and code snippets with syntax highlighting:

```c++
bool getIsTrue(const bool bVal)
{
    return bVal;
}
```

and that's probably all I'll need. Maybe the occasional image or YouTube video.

Like that.

And if I never post on this blog again, that's fine too.

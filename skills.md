Coming from a family of musicians and continuing a lineage of Irish traditional fiddle playing
from the age of 6, I also learned classical violin and piano before teaching myself various
other instruments in my teens and beyond - guitar, bass, flute, English and Anglo concertina, bouzouki and banjo. Since then I've been performing,
recording and composing professionally as well as producing <a href="https://syphus-mods.github.io">8-bit/chiptune music in the demoscene
under the name Syphus since the early 1990s</a>. In the 2000s when chipmusic finally became cool enough
to perform in public, I gigged around the world as Syphus with my Commodore Amiga and a keytar;
particular highlights included two Chiptune Alliance tours of Britain, and Blip Festival in 
New York.
            

Back in the studio I've been commissioned to produce
original musical works for a wide range of clients including BBC Radio 3 Drama, 
BBC Radio 4 Drama, Sunderland A.F.C., Newcastle United Foundation,
The Centre for Process Innovation, We Are Strongness and FME;
and for numerous games on PC/Mac, consoles and mobile.

I've been composing music for games since the late 00s, and since 2017 I've also been working as an audio programmer and sound designer.
As Audio Director at 
<a href="https://cardboardsword.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cardboard Sword</a>
I spend most of my time coding our in-house DAW and middleware, composing our music, and handling all 
sound design production and implementation.
I also step in as a gameplay programmer and build engineer when required.

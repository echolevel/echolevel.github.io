[**Here's** an archive of every chiptune I ever released as syphus](https://syphus-mods.github.io) (or silo7, or lightbomb, or even joey&splif). At least I think it's every tune - there may be others lying around on floppy disks that still haven't seen the light of day. They can all be downloaded in their original tracker module formats and the archive page has some links to modern means of playing back those formats; or you can watch the YouTube playlist above which has all 130+ songs in it.

Sometimes I wake up in the night and make these beats. This video is a collection of all the SU10 beats I posted to Instagram in late 2017 and early 2018, including one short tutorial vid. The tutorial is not that helpful, but it illustrates my process and why I love the SU10: fast, messy, unquantised, absurdly limited tech specs, and the same size as a VHS tape.
